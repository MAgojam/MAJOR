# MAJOR: Meta Analysis JamOvi R
Meta-Analysis Module for JAMOVI

If there’s something missing please open an issue and I’ll be sure to give it a look. 

You will first need to [download Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html). To install this module download the file [MAJOR.jmo](https://github.com/kylehamilton/MAJOR/raw/master/MAJOR.jmo) and select it using the sideload feature in Jamovi.

**Currently MAJOR allows users to meta-analyze**
* Correlation Coefficients
* Cronbach's Alpha
* Dichotomous Outcomes
* Mean Differences
* Proportions
* Effect Sizes and Sampling Variances

### How to contribute

*Imposter syndrome disclaimer*: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

You don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. This project can't work without help from people like you. There is a [code of conduct](https://github.com/kylehamilton/JamoviMeta/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to make sure everyone feels safe and welcome which is something I really believe in. 

Thank you for contributing!
